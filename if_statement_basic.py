# Define the temperature variable
temperature = 35  # Change this value to test different cases

# Check if the temperature is greater than 30
if temperature > 30:
    # Print the message if the condition is true
    print("It's a hot day!")

# Notable Observations:
# - The code inside the if block runs only if the condition is True.
# - Indentation is crucial in Python.
# - You can test different values to see different outputs.
